      CONTEXT
      </div>
      <div className={Classes.para1}>
      SaaS companies are customer-driven and are heavily dependent on their customer base. There
are a set of metrics that can showcase the health of the SaaS companies and their aspects. These
metrics and numbers are not readily available on publicly reported SEC Filings and need to be
chalked out from the available forms (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, etc.). Accessing these metrics can be of
tremendous value to the right users.
Forms that are being filed are very detailed and take time to analyze. For analyzing a form, the
primary task is chalking out the key SaaS numbers. There is a need to have simplified dashboards
to have a quick overview of Key SaaS Goals.

      <div className={Classes.subtitle}>
      FORMS FOR SaaS COMPANIES
      </div>
      <div className={Classes.para1}>
      10K: It is an annual report of the company. Footnotes in 10K forms can help to flag sketchy
accounting practices.
10Q: It is the company's quarterly report that reflects changes in inventory and working capital.
It can be used to draw comparisons between companies.
8K: Used for important announcements, like executive appointments, etc., between filings of a
majority of forms - investors will get non-financial inputs, for example, when TATA sons had a
management change or similar situations.

            NAWCI wants to lay out a comprehensive time-phased,
            5-year roadmap proposal with specific initiatives to
            achieve its end goal of significant carbon reduction.


            The proposal must be supported by relevant data and operate
            within contemporary real-life constraints, e.g., technological
            limitations. Highlight how the solution recommendation will
            help the government achieve the target of the COP26 summit
            and benefits for NAWCI (e.g., tax benefits).

      For example, a proposed initiative to combine deliveries and pick-up should be supported by
expected returns, assessment of last-mile reductions, and, if applicable, the potential impact on
revenue in case of compromise on customer service.
